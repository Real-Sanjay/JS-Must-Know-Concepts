1️⃣ Destructure the array to extract only the first and third elements

const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango", "orange"];

const [fruit1, , fruit2, ] = fruits;

console.log("fruit 1 is " + fruit1 + " fruit 2 is " + fruit2)


2️⃣ Destructure this object and rename fullName to name

const user = { fullName: "Eve Carter", age: 22, country: "Canada" };

const {fullName: name, age, country} = user;

console.log("full name after name change is " + name + " rest of the value: " + age, country);

3️⃣ Use destructuring in a function parameter to extract name and age from the object

const person = { name: "Daniel", age: 40 };

function personDetails({ name, age }) {
  console.log("Person is " + name + " age is " + age);
}

personDetails(person);

4️⃣ Extract values from this nested object

const company = {
  name: "TechCorp",
  location: {
      country: "USA",
      city: "San Francisco"
  }
};

const {name, location:{country, city}} = company;
console.log(`name is ${name}, location is ${country} country and city ${city}`);
