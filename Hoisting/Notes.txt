🚀 JavaScript Hoisting 

🔹 What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before execution.

✅ Example (Without Hoisting)
code
console.log(name); // ❌ ReferenceError: name is not defined
let name = "John";
This throws an error because name is accessed before it’s declared.

🔹 How Variables are Hoisted
1️⃣ var is Hoisted but Undefined
code
console.log(city); // ✅ undefined
var city = "New York";
console.log(city); // ✅ "New York"
✅ The declaration (var city;) is hoisted to the top, but the assignment ("New York") remains in place.

2️⃣ let and const are Hoisted but Not Initialized
code
console.log(age); // ❌ ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
let age = 25;
✅ Unlike var, let and const are hoisted, but they are not initialized, causing a ReferenceError.

3️⃣ Function Declarations are Fully Hoisted
code
sayHello(); // ✅ "Hello, world!"

function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}
✅ The entire function is hoisted, so we can call it before its definition.

4️⃣ Function Expressions are Not Hoisted
code
greet(); // ❌ TypeError: greet is not a function

var greet = function() {
    console.log("Hi!");
};
✅ Only var greet; is hoisted, not the function definition.

🔹 Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
Variables declared with let and const are in a "Temporal Dead Zone" from the start of the block until they are initialized.

code
console.log(x); // ❌ ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
let x = 10;
console.log(x); // ✅ 10
✅ The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) exists from the start of the block until the variable is initialized.

🔹 Hoisting in var vs let vs const
Keyword	Hoisted?	Initialization	Temporal Dead Zone?
var	✅ Yes	✅ Undefined	❌ No
let	✅ Yes	❌ Not initialized	✅ Yes
const	✅ Yes	❌ Not initialized	✅ Yes
🔹 Practical Example – Hoisting in Loops
🚨 Hoisting with var (Global Scope)
code
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}
// ✅ Output: 3, 3, 3 (because `var` has global scope)
✔️ var is hoisted and has function/global scope, so i is overwritten.

✅ Fix with let (Block Scope)
code
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}
// ✅ Output: 0, 1, 2 (because `let` has block scope)
✔️ let ensures each iteration has a new i value.

🔹 Key Takeaways
1️⃣ Function declarations are fully hoisted.
2️⃣ var variables are hoisted but initialized as undefined.
3️⃣ let and const are hoisted but not initialized (TDZ).
4️⃣ Function expressions and arrow functions are not hoisted.
5️⃣ Use let and const instead of var to avoid hoisting issues.
