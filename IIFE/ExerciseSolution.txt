✅ Exercise Answers
1️⃣ Exercise 1 Output:
❌ ReferenceError: message is not defined
👉 Because message is inside the IIFE and not accessible globally.

2️⃣ Exercise 2 Output:
✅ 15
👉 The IIFE takes 5 and 10 as arguments and executes console.log(5 + 10);.

3️⃣ Exercise 3 Fix:
❌ SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')'
✅ Corrected code:
code
(function () {
    console.log("Fixed!");
})();
💡 Parentheses were missing around the IIFE.
