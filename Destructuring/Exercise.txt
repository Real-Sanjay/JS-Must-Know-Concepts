Exercises: Practice Destructuring
1️⃣ Destructure the array to extract only the first and third elements

code
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango", "orange"];
// Your code here
2️⃣ Destructure this object and rename fullName to name

code
const user = { fullName: "Eve Carter", age: 22, country: "Canada" };
// Your code here
3️⃣ Use destructuring in a function parameter to extract name and age from the object

code
const person = { name: "Daniel", age: 40 };
// Your function here
4️⃣ Extract values from this nested object

code
const company = {
    name: "TechCorp",
    location: {
        country: "USA",
        city: "San Francisco"
    }
};
// Extract country and city
