📌 Key Takeaways
1️⃣ Global Scope – Variables accessible anywhere.
2️⃣ Function Scope – Variables exist only inside functions.
3️⃣ Block Scope (let & const) – Variables exist only inside {} blocks.
4️⃣ Closures – Inner functions can access outer function’s variables.
5️⃣ var vs let vs const – Always prefer let and const for better scoping.
6️⃣ Hoisting – Variables declared with var are hoisted as undefined.
