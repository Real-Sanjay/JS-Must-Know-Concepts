 Exercise Answers
 Exercise 1 Output:
 ReferenceError: message is not defined
 Because message is inside the IIFE and not accessible globally.

Exercise 2 Output:
 15
The IIFE takes 5 and 10 as arguments and executes console.log(5 + 10);.

Exercise 3 Fix:
 SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')'
 Corrected code:
code
(function () {
    console.log("Fixed!");
})();
 Parentheses were missing around the IIFE.
